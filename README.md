# Antstack Dashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0.

All the **material design** were done using [Angular Materials](https://material.angular.io/)

## Setting up the environment

Run `npm install` after pulling the sourec code, in the source directory.

## Running Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Dashboard Features

- Dashboard has 2 filters, **Pincode Filter** and **Date Filter**.

LIMITATION of filters: Both the filters don't work together, ie, you can apply one filter at a time.

- I have implemented pagination in the dashboard, because number of records were more than 300. A user can view 5, 10, 25, and 50 rows at a time.

- I have also implemented sort function for all the fields.
